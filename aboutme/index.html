    <h2>Hailey Hobson</h2>
    <p>Howdy :) I'm from Spokane, WA but moved around 
        growing up and have most recently lived in Provo, UT.</p> 
    <p>My major is software development. I've been 
        studying chemical engineering at BYU but got 
        married and moved to Ohio, so have switched 
        to software development online.</p> 
    <p>I love watching sports (Go COUGS!), piano, and
        pole fitness. But I especially love my husband, 
        Erik, and Jesus Christ! He lives and loves us!</p>
